## Post test
#### Please attempt the following questions


Q1. A reflex klystron is oscillating at the frequency of its resonant cavity. If the reflector voltage is made slightly less negative, the<br>

A   Oscillation will cease<br>
B   Output power would increase<br>
<b>C   The frequency will decrease</b><br>
D   Bunching would occur earlier in time<br>
<br>

Q2. The coarse frequency adjustment of a reflex klystron is accomplished by<br>

A   The AFC system<br>
<b>B   Adjusting the flexible wall of the resonant cavity</b><br>
C   An adjustment in the synchronizer<br>
D   Varying the repeller voltage<br><br>

Q3. Klystron oscillators are most often used in the frequency range of<br>
  
A 300 to 3000 MHz<br>
<b>B 3000 to 30000 MHz</b><br>
C 30 to 30000 MHz<br>
D 10 to 10000 MHz<br><br>

Q4. The reflex klystron is often preferred to the two-cavity klystron oscillator because the former<br>
 
A   is more efficient<br>
B   has higher number of modes<br>
<b>C   is easier to tune</b><br>
D   produces a higher output power<br><br>

Q5. Which of the following is one of the mode in Reflex Klystron?<br>

<b>A Give same frequency but different transit time</b><br>
B Are caused by spurious frequency modulation<br>
C Are just for theoretical consideration<br>
D Result from excessive transit time across resonator gap<br><br>
